# E.T.I.S. - Encrypt The Image Safely

Applocks have been ruling the Image securing mehanisms for a decade now. The manufacturers have been implementing various cryptographic approaches to
make their applications more secure. But the question arises 

" Why to build such locks instead you can encrypt your images ? "

E.T.I.S. does the same for you. It takes an vital image of the user and hid it under an trivial image, with no change to the latter one.
